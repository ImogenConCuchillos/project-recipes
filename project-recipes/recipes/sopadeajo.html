      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crispy and lightly browned, <strong>15 to 20 minutes.</strong></li>
      <li>Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a heavy pot over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until just golden, <strong>1 to 2 minutes.</strong> Add ham; cook and stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of paprika and cook for <strong>1 minute more.</strong> Pour bread into pot and toss to coat with hot oil mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour chicken broth into bread mixture; add cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper and stir. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and stir in parsley.</li>
      <li>Crack each egg into a small bowl or cup. Make 4 depressions in the bread on top of the soup with a spoon. Slowly pour an egg into each depression. Cover the pot with a lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolks are thick but not hard, <strong>2 to 3 minutes.</strong> Ladle soup into bowls and spoon an egg on top.</li>
