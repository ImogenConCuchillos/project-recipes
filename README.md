# project-recipies
This is a project to put what I've learned using HTML thus far into something that can be seen publically.
<p>Information in this project will be in the form of a recipie page.</p>

  This is going to utilize many of the commands I've learned involving forming paragraphs, usable links, text sizes, and, possibly some pictures.
   A secondary goal for this project is to make the code as clean and easy to replicated from scratch as possible, for my sake anyway.
    <p><strong>This will be the first of my projects.</p></strong>
